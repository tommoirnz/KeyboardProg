A basic synthesiser in Python. It is quite basic but plays simple tunes and you can record your own. Some example Json files are attached. You can also change key
with the control at the bottom. It shifts up or down in semitones. So one shift when it shows +1 goes from default C major into C# major and -1 goes to B major. +2 goes do D major and so on.
